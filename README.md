## Cloud & Infrastructure Engineer  
**Linux • AWS • VMware • Automation • Monitoring • Reliability**

I’m a Cloud & Linux Engineer with hands-on experience designing, automating, and monitoring infrastructure across AWS and hybrid environments. My work focuses on reliability, observability, and scalable systems — turning manual processes into repeatable, automated solutions.

I’m particularly interested in **Cloud Infrastructure, Platform Engineering, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** roles where automation, monitoring, and system reliability are critical.
