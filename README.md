## Cloud Data Engineer  
**Python • SQL • ETL • Data Quality • Cloud Analytics**

I’m a **Cloud Data Engineer** with hands-on experience building, validating, and analyzing data pipelines in cloud environments. My work focuses on **data extraction, transformation, evaluation, and quality measurement**, using Python and SQL to support reliable, repeatable analytics workflows.

I’ve worked closely with engineers and stakeholders to **identify data gaps, validate outputs, and improve data-driven systems**, including **manual and semi-automated evaluation processes**. I’m especially interested in roles centered on **data quality, model evaluation, analytics enablement, and human-in-the-loop measurement** in cloud-based environments.
